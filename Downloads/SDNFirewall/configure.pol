# CS 6250 Fall 2024 - SDN Firewall Project with POX
# build hackers-45
#
# This file contains the rules for the firewall as specified in the Project Documentation.  
#
# Rule Format:
# RuleNumber,Action,Source MAC,Destination MAC,Source IP,Destination IP,Protocol,Source Port,Destination Port,Comment/Note
# RuleNumber = this is a rule number to help you track a particular rule - it is not used in the firewall implementation
# Action = Block or Allow , Allow Rules need to take precedence over Block Rules
# Source / Destination MAC address in form of xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
# Source / Destination IP Address in form of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx in CIDR notation
# Protocol = integer IP protocol number per IANA (0-254)
# Source / Destination Port = if Protocol is TCP or UDP, this is the Application Port Number per IANA
# Comment/Note = this is for your use in tracking rules.
#
# Any field not being used for a match should have a '-' character as it's entry (except for RuleNumber/Comment)
# Do not pad any of the entries (i.e., have a rule like:  1, Block, -, -,...)
#
# Warning:  For the IP address, you need to specify an appropriate network address
# that matches the subnet mask you are using.  For instance, if you want to use a /16
# subnet mask, then the IP address must be x.x.0.0.  For example, a proper address to 
# reference a 192.168.10.x/24 network would be 192.168.10.0/24.  A single host
# is addressed as a single IP address with a /32.  In other words, the host bit for a 
# subnet other than /32 must be 0.
#
# Rules:
# Task 1: Block all outbound TCP traffic from cn4 to any hosts on the internet
1, Block, -, -, 10.0.30.4/32, 0.0.0.0/0, 6, -, -, Block all outbound TCP traffic from cn4 to the world

# Task 2: Fully isolate host cn5 from the network (block all inbound and outbound traffic)
2, Block, -, -, 10.0.30.5/32, 0.0.0.0/0, -, -, -, Block all outbound traffic from cn5
3, Block, -, -, 0.0.0.0/0, 10.0.30.5/32, -, -, -, Block all inbound traffic to cn5

# Task 3: Allow HQ network hosts to be reachable via ICMP ping from US, UK, and IN subnets
4, Allow, -, -, 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 1, -, -, Allow ICMP ping from HQ to US subnet
5, Allow, -, -, 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.40.0/24, 1, -, -, Allow ICMP ping from HQ to UK subnet
6, Allow, -, -, 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.20.0/24, 1, -, -, Allow ICMP ping from HQ to IN subnet

# Task 4: Prevent host cn3 from responding to any TCP web server requests (HTTP and HTTPS), excluding traffic from the CN subnet
7, Block, -, -, 10.0.30.3/32, 0.0.0.0/0, 6, 80, -, Block HTTP response from cn3
8, Block, -, -, 10.0.30.3/32, 0.0.0.0/0, 6, 443, -, Block HTTPS response from cn3

# Task 5: Servers on hosts us3 and us4 process financial data on TCP ports 9250-9520. Access to this service is blocked from specific hosts.
9, Block, -, -, 10.0.40.128/28, 10.0.1.33/32, 6, 9250-9520, -, Block financial data access to us3 from restricted hosts
10, Block, -, -, 10.0.40.128/28, 10.0.1.34/32, 6, 9250-9520, -, Block financial data access to us4 from restricted hosts

# Task 6: Block a rogue Raspberry Pi device on the network (impersonating host us1â€™s network address) from accessing the internet via UDP
11, Block, -, -, 10.0.1.1/32, 0.0.0.0/0, 17, -, -, Block all outbound UDP traffic from us1 replica to the world

# Task 7: Block external access to TCP port 25 on all corporate subnets
12, Block, -, -, 0.0.0.0/0, 10.0.1.0/24, 6, 25, -, Block external access to TCP port 25 in US subnet
13, Block, -, -, 0.0.0.0/0, 10.0.40.0/24, 6, 25, -, Block external access to TCP port 25 in UK subnet
14, Block, -, -, 0.0.0.0/0, 10.0.20.0/24, 6, 25, -, Block external access to TCP port 25 in IN subnet
15, Block, -, -, 0.0.0.0/0, 10.0.0.0/24, 6, 25, -, Block external access to TCP port 25 in HQ subnet
